Some background on this document, its history and impact, in rough chronological order.

## History 

* [April 4, 2013](https://twitter.com/vdavez/status/319840540025843712?t=1&refsrc=email&iid=8dc3ab45-3c58-4ee6-aca5-944769eec59b&uid=352686442&nid=4+251). **[@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData)** worked with the DC Council to get the DC Code [released under a CC0 public domain license](https://dccouncil.us/UnofficialDCCode), following a kerfuffle raised by **[@tmcw](https://github.com/tmcw)** over its [prior lack of public availability](https://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html) outside of a locked-down vendor.

* May 9, 2013. The White House published a [Memorandum on Open Data Policy (M-13-13)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf) and a related [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-). The policy recommended the use of "open licensing" for all open government data. [@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData) wrote that this was [a step backward](https://razor.occams.info/blog/2013/05/09/new-open-data-memorandum-almost-defines-open-data-misses-mark-with-open-licenses/).

* May 31, 2013. **[@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData)**'s contract work for HHS also gave him the opportunity to try out some very simple, best practice [license language](https://github.com/HHS/ckanext-datajson#credit--copying) on a CKAN extension he worked on for HealthData.gov.

* May-June 2013. The White House released [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov), its guidance for agencies in implementing the Obama administration's open data executive order. **[@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData)** and **[@konklone](https://github.com/konklone)**, along with others, opened [some](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/issues/5) [discussions](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/64) with Project Open Data, encouraging its [licensing section](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/license-examples/) to have stronger language and clearer norms around the nature of license-free US government information.

* August 19, 2013. To clarify the issue, **[@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData)**, **[@konklone](https://github.com/konklone)**, and **[@jwyg](https://github.com/jwyg)**, with help from **[@tvol](https://github.com/tvol)** and **[@punkish](https://github.com/punkish)**, produced [version 1](https://razor.occams.info/pubdocs/2013-08-19_license_free.pdf) of this guidance document, referencing the two previous in-government examples **[@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData)** had worked on, and he [blogged about the motivation](https://razor.occams.info/blog/2013/08/19/guidance-federal-agencies-can-make-their-data-license-free/).

## Impact

* August 25, 2013. Partly in response to our nudging, Project Open Data (POD) began the process to [re-license itself](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/135) --- the POD schema and associated code --- as international public domain under CC0, and completed re-licensing on October 17, 2013. (This also yielded an interesting discussion around Unlicense vs CC0.)

* September 3, 2013. The CFPB then [licensed its qu project internationally as CC0](https://github.com/cfpb/qu/pull/94), explicitly citing our document and the prior Project Open Data thread as motivation. In that qu thread, **[@Burton](https://github.com/Burton)** [indicated](https://github.com/cfpb/qu/pull/94#issuecomment-23577645) our document applied more to data than software - so our v2 [added a paragraph](https://github.com/unitedstates/licensing/commit/b0a20cb2e1e51fe534ea34a17e26e127fcaf46a8) about that.

* October 22, 2013. The **[@cfpb](https://github.com/cfpb)** then also took its [eRegs platform](https://cfpb.github.io/eRegulations/) and [licensed it as CC0 internationally](https://github.com/eregs/eregulations/pull/6), citing the Project Open Data and qu threads.

* December 12, 2013. Version 2 of this document was released at [theunitedstates.io/licensing](https://theunitedstates.io/licensing/). It includes a rewritten introduction, guidance on licensing software, and a number of other tweaks. A breakdown and some discussion of the changes can be found on [pull request #1](https://github.com/unitedstates/licensing/pull/1). This version was [signed onto](https://theunitedstates.io/licensing/#authors) by a wide variety of people and public interest organizations.

* April 7, 2014. [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) [added its name to the guidance](https://github.com/unitedstates/licensing/issues/19) as a supporter and co-author.

* May 9, 2014. On the 1-year anniversary of the Memorandom on Open Data Policy, the White House released a [U.S. Open Data Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf), using language from our guidance (see page 2) to release the plan into the worldwide public domain.

* July 29, 2014. [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), a recently created technology and services team inside the General Services Administration, [publicly adopts](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/) an [open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) that incorporates this project's recommendations into its [default software license](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

* August 12, 2014. The United States Digital Service (USDS) launches, along with a "Playbook" including a checklist on [defaulting to open](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play13) that specifically calls for dedicating government data to the international public domain and cites CC0.

* November 23, 2015. The District of Columbia [makes CC0 the default for all DC open source projects](https://github.com/DCgov/license).
